This board is to provide a neater and more reliable mounting for the PCR-SIN03 ringing generators often found on eBay,
the board has a barrel jack so the module can be powered by a wall wart, a voltage divider to provide 5V for the INHibit line
to gate ringing or create a cadence. There is also an 8 position 0.100 connector for power, daisy chain, INH/5VR and ringing output.
